# Mathematical Modeling of Neurodegenerative Disease Progression Using PDEs
This study explores the progression of prions, focusing on various types of prions, each exhibiting unique rates of transmission and pathology. Given that prion diseases are currently incurable, understanding their progression dynamics is critical for informing potential therapeutic strategies.

We employ partial differential equations (PDEs) to model the spatial and temporal dynamics of prion spread within the brain tissue. Starting with diffusion equations, we analyze how the initial external introduction of prions influences their subsequent infiltration into neural structures. We then utilize reaction-diffusion models to capture the interactions between prion aggregates and neuronal cells, highlighting the differential effects of each prion type on disease progression rates.

Additionally, we incorporate hyperbolic PDEs to address the rapid changes observed during acute phases of prion infection. By simulating the progression of each prion type, we aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying their varying rates of spread and impact on brain function.
